# Contributing to SIAR

First off, thank you for considering contributing to **SIAR** (*Survivable Identity & Autonomous Routing*), a research initiative developed and stewarded under **[Irshad Lab](https://irshadlab.org)** ([`@irshadlab`](https://github.com/irshadlab))! 🚀

SIAR is a zero-infrastructure, multi-transport, offline-first decentralized messaging and delay-tolerant networking (DTN) platform built to guarantee private, autonomous communications for humanity.

## Architecture & Design Principles

Before writing code, please understand SIAR's architectural boundaries:

```
┌────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│         UI & APPS LAYER (GNU AGPLv3 / Commercial)      │
│  apps/cli, apps/desktop, apps/android,                 │
│  apps/emergency-node, crates/siar-ui-state,            │
│  crates/siar-ui-slint, crates/siar-ui-model,           │
│  crates/siar-app-core                                  │
└───────────────────────────┬────────────────────────────┘
                            │
┌───────────────────────────▼────────────────────────────┐
│   CORE HEADLESS LIBRARIES LAYER (MIT OR Apache-2.0)    │
│  crates/siar-messaging, crates/siar-storage,           │
│  crates/siar-crypto-mls, crates/siar-transport,        │
│  crates/siar-routing-policy, crates/siar-dtn-bundle,   │
│  crates/siar-connectivity, etc.                        │
└────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

1. **Rust is the Primary Core Engine (95%+ Codebase)**: All cryptography, binary wire serialization, DTN queues, routing tables, storage engines, and multi-transport socket management are written in pure modern Rust (2021 Edition).
2. **Kotlin for Android UI Only**: Kotlin is strictly used in `apps/android` for Jetpack Compose UI and native Android OS hardware bindings, interfacing directly with the Rust engine via zero-copy C-ABI JNI bridges.
3. **Strict Boundary Isolation**:
   - `crates/siar-domain`: Pure domain models, zero heavy I/O dependencies.
   - `crates/siar-storage`: Pure-Rust embedded SQL storage engine abstraction.
   - `crates/siar-transport`: Transport-agnostic pool (BLE, Wi-Fi Direct, Wi-Fi Aware, BT Classic, Iroh QUIC).
4. **Zero Panic in Production Code**: Do not use `unwrap()` or `expect()` in non-test code paths. Always use idiomatic error propagation via `Result<T, E>` and `thiserror`.

## Development Environment & Prerequisites

### 1. Rust Toolchain
Install Rust using [rustup](https://rustup.rs/):
```bash
rustup toolchain install 1.91
rustup default 1.91
rustup component add clippy rustfmt
```

### 2. Android NDK (For Android Development)
If you plan to compile native JNI libraries for Android:
```bash
cargo install cargo-ndk
rustup target add aarch64-linux-android armv7-linux-androideabi i686-linux-android x86_64-linux-android
```

---

## Development Workflow

### 1. Clone & Build
```bash
git clone https://github.com/irshadlab/siar.git
cd siar
cargo build --workspace
```

### 2. Create a Feature Branch
Use descriptive branch names:
```bash
git checkout -b feat/my-new-feature
# or
git checkout -b fix/routing-deadlock
```

### 3. Verify Code Quality Locally
Before pushing your branch, run the local verification suite:
```bash
# 1. Format check
cargo fmt --all -- --check

# 2. Clippy linter (zero warnings allowed)
cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -- -D warnings

# 3. Workspace unit tests
cargo test --workspace

# 4. Dependency license & security audit
cargo deny check
```

## Code Style & Best Practices

- **Error Handling**: Use [`thiserror`](https://docs.rs/thiserror) for typed, actionable errors in `crates/*` libraries; use [`anyhow`](https://docs.rs/anyhow) for application-level error contexts in `apps/*`.
- **Async Runtime**: Use `tokio` for async orchestration. Never block async executor worker threads with long-running synchronous CPU operations (use `tokio::task::spawn_blocking` where appropriate).
- **Zero-Copy & Memory Efficiency**: Favor `bytes::Bytes` and borrowed slices (`&[u8]`) over cloning large memory buffers.
- **Documentation**: Provide clear Rust doc comments (`///`) on all public types, structs, methods, and traits.

---

## Testing, Benchmarking & Fuzzing

### Unit & Integration Tests
Write tests alongside modules in `#[cfg(test)]` submodules or in `tests/` integration directories:
```bash
cargo test -p siar-messaging
cargo test -p siar-storage
```

### Fuzzing
For binary protocol framing and wire codecs (`crates/siar-protocol`), run the cargo-fuzz targets:
```bash
cargo install cargo-fuzz
cd fuzz
cargo fuzz run decode_frame
cargo fuzz run decode_blob_frame
```
