//! §28 "Transfer Journal".
//!
//! §28's own instruction is as much about what NOT to build as what
//! to: "high-frequency operational state belongs in a transfer
//! journal/projection... do not append a permanent event for every
//! packet. Part 04 event log stores meaningful semantic transitions."
//! [`TransferJournal`] is that separate, non-durable home — nothing in
//! this module ever constructs a [`crate::events::FileEvent`] or
//! touches `siar-event-log`, on purpose. It exists alongside
//! [`crate::transfer_record::TransferRecord`] (which DOES eventually
//! back onto durable events, via each domain's own state-machine
//! transitions) rather than folded into it, so the high-frequency
//! fields below can be mutated as often as every chunk arrives without
//! that ever being mistaken for something a caller should be recording
//! to the event log.

use crate::resume::ResumeBitmap;

/// §28's own four named examples, each field-for-field:
/// - `chunk_bitmap` → reuses [`ResumeBitmap`] rather than a second
///   bitset type, since it's already exactly this shape (§29).
/// - `bytes_verified` → running total, updated by
///   [`TransferJournal::record_chunk_verified`].
/// - `active_path` → deliberately a bare `Option<String>` label, not a
///   real transport/routing type: this crate has no dependency on
///   `siar-transport`/`siar-routing-policy` (see `lib.rs`'s own "no
///   transport/routing integration" scope note), so a real caller
///   supplies whatever it uses to name a path (a `TransportKind`'s
///   `Debug` output, a relay id, anything) rather than this crate
///   inventing a path-identity type it has no other use for.
/// - `retry_count` → bumped by [`TransferJournal::record_retry`].
