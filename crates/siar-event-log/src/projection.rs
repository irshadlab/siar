//! `04-offline-event-log-architecture.md` §16 "Projection Architecture",
//! §17 "Projection Checkpoints", §18 "Read-Your-Writes" — §92 Phase 4.
//!
//! §16's own diagram is the whole shape of this module:
//!
//! ```text
//! Event Journal
//!     ↓
//! Projection Runner
//!     ↓
//! Materialized Views
//! ```
//!
//! [`Projection`] is one materialized view's own update logic (§16's
//! examples: `messages`, `conversation_summary`, `transfer_state`,
//! `device_directory`, `group_state`, `dtn_bundle_state`,
//! `emergency_state` — this crate defines none of those; each belongs
//! in the crate that owns that domain, same reasoning §33-35's own
//! event catalogs already follow, per this crate's own top doc
//! comment). [`ProjectionRunner::catch_up`] is the "Projection Runner"
//! arrow: pull events from an [`crate::store::EventStore`] in log
//! order, `apply` each to a [`Projection`], and persist a
//! [`ProjectionCheckpoint`] (§17, verbatim field names) so a restart
//! resumes instead of replaying from the beginning.
//!
//! ## §16's four requirements, and which ones this module can actually
//! enforce
//!
//! - **versioned**: enforced structurally — [`Projection::
//!   projection_version`] is compared against the saved checkpoint's
//!   own `projection_version` on every [`ProjectionRunner::catch_up`]
//!   call; a mismatch means the projection's own `apply` logic changed
//!   since last run (a real schema/logic bump), not merely restarted,
//!   and triggers [`Projection::reset`] + a full replay from offset 0.
//! - **rebuildable**: also enforced structurally, via the same
//!   version-mismatch path — `reset` is a real trait method a
//!   `Projection` implementer must supply, not optional.
//! - **deterministic** and **idempotent**: NOT enforced by this
//!   module — properties of what a `Projection` implementer's own
//!   `apply` does with each event, which nothing here can verify from
//!   the outside. Named honestly rather than silently assumed.
//!
//! ## §18 "Read-Your-Writes": what this module does and doesn't give
//! for free
//!
//! §18's own text: "critical projections update in the same
//! transaction as the event." [`ProjectionRunner::catch_up`] does NOT
//! do that — it is a separate pull, called after `append` returns, not
//! inside the same `stoolap` transaction `stoolap_store::append` uses.
//! Building genuine same-transaction updates would mean either coupling
//! `EventStore::append` itself to a specific set of registered
//! projections (breaking §19/§92's own backend-neutral, domain-
//! agnostic design this crate has kept throughout Phases 1-3) or
//! accepting projection callbacks as a parameter on `append` (a real,
//! bigger trait redesign, not attempted here). What this module DOES
//! give a caller, and what's actually sufficient for §18's own concrete
//! example ("SendMessage succeeds locally → conversation immediately
//! shows message") in a single-process, no-concurrent-writer setting:
//! calling `catch_up` synchronously right after a successful `append`
//! returns, before doing anything else — see `siar_messaging::
//! service`'s own real caller for exactly this pattern. That's "read-
//! your-writes in practice," not "read-your-writes by construction";
//! the difference matters if this crate ever grows a concurrent-writer
//! story that assumption doesn't survive.
