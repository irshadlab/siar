//! `04-offline-event-log-architecture.md` §84 "Crash Injection Tests"
//! — the spec's own five injection points, each given a real test
//! proving deterministic recovery, using [`FaultInjectingEventStore`]
//! (this crate's own new fault-injection wrapper — see its own doc
//! comment) plus [`siar_startup_recovery::reconcile`] (§48, already
//! built) for the one point that's really about a missing work-table
//! entry rather than the event log itself.
//!
//! A real process can't be killed mid-`await` from inside its own
//! test suite in any portable way — these five tests instead inject
//! the SAME observable failure a real crash at each point would leave
//! behind (nothing written; a write whose response never arrived; a
//! write that landed with no corresponding follow-up work scheduled),
//! then verify a fresh, ordinary recovery path (retry, replay,
//! reconcile) converges to the single correct outcome regardless.
