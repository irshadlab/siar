#![forbid(unsafe_code)]

//! `04-offline-event-log-architecture.md` §34's own named gap, closed:
//! `siar_blob_manifest::events::FileEvent` (§34's catalog) and
//! `siar_blob_manifest::transfer_state::TransferState` (§26's state
//! machine) have both existed since Phase 3, but neither one had a
//! real `siar_event_log::EventStore::append` caller anywhere in this
//! workspace — every one of `FileEvent`'s own doc comments says so
//! outright ("no real `EventStore::append` caller anywhere for this
//! domain"), and `ROADMAP.md`'s own §34/§93(#11)/§95 rows repeat it.
//! This crate is that caller — the same shape
//! `siar_messaging::service::MessageService::record_messaging_event`
//! already is for §33's messaging events: a small service that
//! DECIDES (calls [`TransferState::transition`]) and, only once that
//! decision succeeds, RECORDS (builds the matching [`FileEvent`] and
//! calls [`siar_event_log::append_with_retry`]) — exactly the "decide
//! vs record" split `siar_blob_manifest::events`'s own doc comment
//! already names as the intended shape for whichever crate closed
//! this gap.
//!
//! ## Why a new crate, not a method added to `siar-blob-manifest` itself
//!
//! `siar_blob_manifest::events`'s own top doc comment is explicit that
//! the crate deliberately has no dependency on `siar-event-log` for
//! *appending* (only for constructing `NewEvent` values): "a module
//! that called `EventStore::append` itself would be a new,
//! undocumented dependency this crate doesn't otherwise have." Adding
//! that dependency there would reverse a stated design decision rather
//! than build on it. This follows the same shape `siar-event-registry`
//! already used to close §63: a new crate that depends on the domain
//! crate it serves, rather than growing that domain crate's own scope.
//!
//! ## What this closes, and what it doesn't
//!
//! Closes: §34/§95's "no real caller" gap for files, and half of
//! §93's Definition-of-Done item 11 ("file semantic state survives
//! restart") — a real, tested path from a transfer-lifecycle decision
//! to a durably-recordable event now exists. The OTHER half of #11 —
//! some real caller in `apps/*` actually driving a live transfer
//! through [`FileTransferService`], wired to real chunk transfer, not
//! just a test calling it directly — is still not done; nothing in
//! this workspace's uploaded `apps/` crates constructs one yet. This
//! also does not touch §35 (identity) or §36/§37 (DTN/emergency),
//! which have the identical "catalog exists, no real caller" gap
//! under a different domain — this crate's shape is the template for
//! whoever closes those next, not a claim that this closes them too.
//!
//! ## One real mismatch this crate had to resolve, not paper over
//!
//! `siar_blob_manifest::transfer_state::TransferEvent::Fail` is a bare
//! variant with no payload, but `FileEvent::TransferFailed` carries a
//! `reason: String` the transition table has no way to supply. Rather
//! than silently recording an empty/placeholder reason,
//! [`FileTransferService::apply`] refuses `TransferEvent::Fail`
//! outright ([`FileTransferError::FailNeedsReason`]) and
//! [`FileTransferService::fail_transfer`] exists as the one call site
//! that both performs that specific transition and has a real reason
//! to record alongside it.
